      <description>Source Code: https://github.com/uohziyoam/Intro-to-NN
 Problem Definition In this context, it requires us to generate a non-linear classification by utilizing neural network to fit in our model.  Experiments In my experiments, I followed the instruction about data method by using 5-fold round robin cross-validation. The data were didvided into five sets, and choose four of them as training set and rest of them as testing set. The program repeatedtly train the model five times with randomly choosed set from original 2000 data points.</description>
